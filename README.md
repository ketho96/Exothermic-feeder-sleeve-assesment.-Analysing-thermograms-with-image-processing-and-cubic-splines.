# feeder_evaluation
These scripts are part of the bachelor thesis "Entwicklung einer Auswerteroutine für ein Prüfverfahren für exotherme Speiser auf Basis der Programmiersprache Python" which translates to: "Development of an evaluation routine for a test procedure for exothermic risers based on the Python programming language". Most of the comments are written in german, even though I tried to name the variables in english. Please see the README.py file for the most important parts of the code formatted in PEP8 and exclusively in english.

If you have questions please use the email adresses provided in the README.py file.
